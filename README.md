Test Solutions

# About

The solutions are divided by folders.
Each folder contains a solution to mentioned task. They can be identified by suffix in folder names.

All the solutions use raw NodeJS as preferred by the test.

Solutions are written in JavaScript instead of TypeScript to keep things simple.

Very minimal use of third-party libraries.

All the solutions contain 2 source files, one exports the app/server called app.js and the other file listens using the exported server in server.js. This helps in testing the application.

Basic end-to-end api tests are included to some quick testing.

All the solutions only support the address passed via query params to be of either http or https protocol.

# Getting Started

To use the solutions, kindly cd to the specific solution directory and run:

1. npm i
2. npm start

To run tests:

- npm run test

# Final Words

Have a nice day!
